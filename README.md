# Progressive Web App

create a progressive web application.

## Requirements

- in a browser a user can navigate to the application
- save the application to their smart device
- use some or all of the application offline

## Notes

[Google](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) has some nice tools for making offline web applications. If youre into Rust, [Woz](https://woz.sh/) is a neat tool chain that leans on web assembly. [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/apps/) is extremely popular and has a [PWA starter](https://pwa-starter-kit.polymer-project.org/). [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is another popular choice. [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) seems cool too.

## Examples

- [Webnfc](https://webnfc-shoppingcart.appspot.com/#!/home) - An NFC shopping cart
- [Snapwat](https://snapw.at/) - put emojis on photos
- [WebFlap](https://www.progressivewebflap.com/) - flappybird clone
- [Airhorn](https://airhorner.com/) - yup. thats what it does
- [Notes](https://github.com/SimonDEvans/notes) - probably the best example
